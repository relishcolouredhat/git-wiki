# Resources for Learning about Electronics

## Introduction

This page will talk about resources for learning about electronics in general. This information will be able to apply to all your future interactions with the modern world - with a solid foundation to better understand the technologies which built that world.

It is also useful for [FRC](frc), which is likely what brought us together here.

*If your main purpose here is to look for reference materials for using [FRC](frc) equpment ( such as motor controllers, pneumatics, and motors, with or without the roborio ) specifically; visit the page [FRC Electronics Equipment](building-electronics-with-frc-equipment) for guides and reference materials.*

## Where to get started?

Before we can talk intelligently about using electricity, we need a common language to speak in. 

So to begin, we must have an idea of what is the meaning of the [electrical terminology](electrical-terminology) of [voltage](voltage), [current](current), [resistance](resistance), and [power](power).

Once we understand that - we can then talk about how [ohm's law](ohms-law) and [watt's law](watts-law) govern how they interact with eachother.

These concepts will still be very abstract, but will give the foundation for us to distinguish between  
[Direct Current](direct-current) and [Alternating Current](alternating-current) electronics. (of which we will focus on the former for now)

All this - so that we can now talk about the [electronic components](electronic-components) which make up [circuits](circuits), tying it all together.

With this solid basis of understanding, you will have the tools necessary to build  [electronic projects](electronic-projects) and begin to master [the art of troubleshooting](the-art-of-troubleshooting)

## Electronics Journey, Level 1: *Sparky*

### Terminology:
  - Voltage, Current, Power, Resistance

#### [Resistance](resistance)
```
SI Symbol: R
SI Unit  : Ohm ( â„¦ )
```
- A measure of how 'hard' an electron must 'push' to move through a material 
- Sort of 'friction' for electrons
- Materials with very low [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance) pass electricity easily, and are known as [conductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor)
- A measure of how much of the energy in the electrons is converted to heat in a conductor


#### [Conductors](conductors)
- Conductors are the term for materials which have low [resistance](resistance) to electrical flow.
- All materials will conduct electricity, given the proper conditions.
- Conductors refer to materials which are chosen to intentionally conduct electricity due to their properties.
- Typically, gold is known as the best conductor you would run into, followed by silver and copper.
- Most metals conduct electricity, but are poor conductors compared to copper.
- Salt water, Metals, Some gasses, and human flesh are all fairly good conductors.

#### [Insulators](insulators)
- Insulators are materials that have high [resistance](resistance) to electricity.
- Air, Ceramics, Wood, and Pure water, and human skin- are all usually known as [insulators](insulators) since they conduct electricity poorly.

#### [Voltage](voltage)
```
SI Symbol: E
SI Unit  : Volt ( V )
```
>"The Electromotive Force"
- How hard can each electron push?
- Measure of Potential Energy
- A Measure of energy difference
- Determines how much work each electron can do.
- Determines how much insulation a conductor must have to be safe to touch.


#### [Current](current)
```
SI Symbol: I
SI Unit  : Ampere ( A )
```
> How many electrons are there?

- A measure of the amount of electrons passing a given point per second.
- Determines how thick a conductor must be before it will start to get hot.



#### [Power](power)
```
SI Symbol: P
SI Unit  : Watt ( W )
Formulae : 
 - I * E = P
 aka
 - V * A * W
 aka
 - Voltage * Current = Wattage
 aka 
 - Volts * Amps = Watts
 
```
>"The amount of work you can do is a combination of how many electrons there are, and how hard they are pushing."

- Calculated by combing the [Voltage](voltage) with the [Current](current).

## Basic Laws of how Electricity Behaves



### [Ohm's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law)
[!][Ohm's Law Formula](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ccb6636ea16861f62089604333e92855888f0db2)
[!][Ohm's Law Formula](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Ohm%27s_law_triangle.svg/1280px-Ohm%27s_law_triangle.svg.png)


>Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.

Voltage = Resistance * Amperage 

- Watt's Power Law

Watt = Amp *
