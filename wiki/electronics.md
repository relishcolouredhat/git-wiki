# Resources for Learning about Electronics

## Introduction

This page will talk about resources for learning about electronics in general. This information will be able to apply to all your future interactions with the modern world - with a solid foundation to better understand the technologies which built that world.

It is also useful for [FRC](frc), which is likely what brought us together here.

*If your main purpose here is to look for reference materials for using [FRC](frc) equpment ( such as motor controllers, pneumatics, and motors, with or without the roborio ) specifically; visit the page [FRC Electronics Equipment](building-electronics-with-frc-equipment) for guides and reference materials.*

## Where to get started?

Before we can talk intelligently about using electricity, we need a common language to speak in. 

So to begin, we must have an idea of what is the meaning of the [electrical terminology](electrical-terminology) of [voltage](voltage), [current](current), [resistance](resistance), and [power](power).

Once we understand that - we can then talk about how [ohm's law](ohms-law) and [watt's law](watts-law) govern how they interact with eachother.

These concepts will still be very abstract, but will give the foundation for us to distinguish between  
[Direct Current](direct-current) and [Alternating Current](alternating-current) electronics. (of which we will focus on the former for now)

All this - so that we can now talk about the [electronic components](electronic-components) which make up [circuits](circuits), tying it all together.

With this solid basis of understanding, you will have the tools necessary to build  [electronic projects](electronic-projects) and begin to master [the art of troubleshooting](the-art-of-troubleshooting)

## Electronics Journey, Level 1: *Sparky*

Terminology:
  - Voltage, Current, Power, Resistance

### [Voltage](voltage)
```
SI Symbol: E
SI Unit  : Volt ( V )
```
>"The Electromotive Force"
- How hard can each electron push?
- Measure of Potential Energy
- A Measure of energy difference
- Determines how much work each electron can do.


### [Current](current)
```
SI Symbol: I
SI Unit  : Ampere ( A )
```
> How many electrons are there?

- A measure of the amount of electrons passing a given point
- Determines 

### [Power](power)
```
SI Symbol: P
SI Unit  : Watt ( W )
Formulae : 
 - I * E = P
 aka
 - V * A * W
 aka
 - Voltage * Current = Wattage
 aka 
 - Volts * Amps = Watts
 
```
>"The amount of work you can do is a combination of how many electrons there are, and how hard they are pushing."

- Calculated by combing the [Voltage](voltage) with the [Current](current).

- [Ohm's Law](ohms-law)

Voltage = Resistance * Amperage 

- Watt's Power Law

Watt = Amp *
