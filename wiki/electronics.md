#### Electronics Journey, Level 1: *Sparky*

Terminology:
  - Voltage, Current, Power, Resistance

##### Voltage
```
SI Symbol: E
SI Unit  : Volt ( V )
```
>"The Electromotive Force"
- How hard can each electron push?
- Measure of Potential Energy
- A Measure of energy difference
- Determines how much work each electron can do.


##### Current
```
SI Symbol: I
SI Unit  : Ampere ( A )
```
> How many electrons are there?

- A measure of the amount of electrons passing a given point
- Determines 

##### Power
```
SI Symbol: P
SI Unit  : Watt ( W )
```
>"Electromotive Force"
- "Electrical Pressure"
- Easy to measure


---


- Ohm's Law

Voltage = Resistance * Amperage 

- Watt's Power Law

Watt = Amp *
